## 13.1.  Describe the physiology of breathing.

The **physiology of breathing**, also known as **respiration**, involves two main processes: **inhalation** (inspiration) and **exhalation** (expiration). These processes allow the body to take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide.

### 1. **Inhalation (Inspiration)**:
   - **Diaphragm contracts**: The primary muscle involved in breathing, the diaphragm, contracts and moves downward, increasing the space in the chest cavity.
   - **Intercostal muscles contract**: The muscles between the ribs (intercostal muscles) also contract, lifting the ribcage and further expanding the chest cavity.
   - **Air enters the lungs**: The expansion of the chest cavity decreases the pressure inside the lungs compared to the outside air, causing air to flow in through the nose or mouth, down the trachea, and into the lungs.
   - **Gas exchange in alveoli**: Oxygen in the inhaled air passes through the thin walls of the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs) into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide from the blood is transferred into the alveoli to be exhaled.

### 2. **Exhalation (Expiration)**:
   - **Diaphragm relaxes**: The diaphragm moves upward as it relaxes, reducing the space in the chest cavity.
   - **Intercostal muscles relax**: The ribcage moves downward and inward as the intercostal muscles relax.
   - **Air exits the lungs**: The reduced chest cavity increases pressure in the lungs, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs, through the trachea, and out of the body.
   - **Carbon dioxide is expelled**: The air leaving the lungs contains carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular metabolism, which is exhaled from the body.

### **Control of Breathing**:
Breathing is primarily controlled by the **medulla oblongata**, a part of the brainstem that monitors carbon dioxide levels in the blood. When carbon dioxide levels rise, signals are sent to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to increase the breathing rate, ensuring proper oxygen intake and carbon dioxide removal.

This process of breathing is critical for maintaining the body's oxygen supply and removing waste gases, essential for energy production and cellular function.


## 13.2.  Identify the primary muscle of ventilation.

The primary muscle of ventilation is the diaphragm.

Located at the base of the lungs, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward during inhalation, expanding the chest cavity and allowing air to flow into the lungs. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and moves upward, decreasing the space in the chest cavity and forcing air out of the lungs. This rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the diaphragm is essential for effective breathing.


## 13.3.  List the normal respiratory rate for individuals in the following age groups: infant, child, and adult.

Here are the normal respiratory rates for different age groups:

1. **Infant (birth to 1 year)**: 30-60 breaths per minute.
2. **Child (1 to 12 years)**: 18-30 breaths per minute.
3. **Adult (12 years and older)**: 12-20 breaths per minute.

These rates are general guidelines for healthy individuals at rest. Elevated rates may indicate distress or other medical conditions.

## 13.4.  Identify the most common cause of airway obstruction.

The most common cause of airway obstruction is the **tongue** falling back into the throat. This typically occurs when a person is unconscious or in a reduced state of consciousness, such as during sleep, trauma, or medical emergencies, where muscle tone is diminished, and the tongue can block the airway. Other common causes of obstruction include foreign objects (e.g., food), swelling (due to allergic reactions or infections), or trauma to the airway.

## 13.5.  List the signs and symptoms of respiratory emergencies.

Here are the common **signs and symptoms** of respiratory emergencies:

1. **Shortness of breath** or difficulty breathing (dyspnea).
2. **Rapid or shallow breathing** (tachypnea).
3. **Gasping for air** or labored breathing.
4. **Wheezing** or other abnormal breath sounds (e.g., stridor, crackles).
5. **Cyanosis** (bluish discoloration of the lips, skin, or fingernails).
6. **Chest pain** or tightness.
7. **Use of accessory muscles** (neck, chest, or abdomen) to breathe.
8. **Nasal flaring** (common in children).
9. **Coughing** (with or without sputum or blood).
10. **Altered mental status** (e.g., confusion, anxiety, or agitation).
11. **Fatigue or weakness** due to prolonged effort to breathe.
12. **Inability to speak in full sentences** due to breathlessness.
13. **Pale or sweaty skin** (diaphoresis).

These symptoms indicate a respiratory emergency and require immediate medical attention.


## 13.6.  Describe and demonstrate how to assess a patient who is having difficulty breathing.

To assess a patient who is having difficulty breathing, follow these key steps:

### **1. Scene Safety and Initial Assessment:**
- **Ensure scene safety**: Check that it’s safe for you and the patient.
- **Introduce yourself**: Explain that you are trained to help and ask for consent to provide care.
- **Assess the patient’s responsiveness**: Determine if the patient is alert and oriented or in distress.

### **2. Perform a Primary Assessment (ABC):**
- **A – Airway**: Ensure the airway is open and clear. If not, clear any obstructions.
- **B – Breathing**: Check if the patient is breathing adequately:
   - Observe **chest rise**: Is the chest rising normally with each breath?
   - Count the **respiratory rate**: Count the number of breaths in 30 seconds and multiply by two. Normal rates: 
     - Adults: 12-20 breaths per minute
     - Children: 18-30 breaths per minute
     - Infants: 30-60 breaths per minute
   - Assess **depth and effort**: Is the breathing shallow or labored? Are they using accessory muscles?
   - Listen for **abnormal sounds**: Check for wheezing, stridor, or crackles.
   - **Feel for air movement**: Place your cheek near their mouth to feel if air is moving in and out.
- **C – Circulation**: Check for cyanosis (bluish skin) around the lips, fingers, or toes, which indicates poor oxygenation.

### **3. Ask Questions (SAMPLE History):**
To better understand the situation, ask the patient about:
- **S**: Signs and symptoms – "How are you feeling? What are your symptoms?"
- **A**: Allergies – "Do you have any known allergies?"
- **M**: Medications – "Are you taking any medications for breathing issues?"
- **P**: Past medical history – "Have you had any breathing problems in the past?"
- **L**: Last oral intake – "When did you last eat or drink?"
- **E**: Events leading up to the issue – "What were you doing before this started?"

### **4. Perform a Physical Exam:**
- **Observe chest movement**: Watch for symmetry. If one side of the chest moves differently, this could indicate a collapsed lung or injury.
- **Listen with a stethoscope** (if available):
   - Listen to the lungs in various places on the chest and back for abnormal breath sounds like wheezing or crackles.
- **Check for retractions**: Look for sinking of the skin between the ribs or above the collarbones, a sign of labored breathing.
- **Look for nasal flaring or pursed-lip breathing**, which indicates difficulty breathing.

### **5. Monitor Oxygen Saturation (if equipment is available):**
- Use a pulse oximeter to check the patient’s oxygen saturation level. Normal levels should be between 95-100%. Levels below 90% indicate a serious issue.

### **6. Provide Appropriate Care:**
- **Position the patient**: Help the patient sit up in a position that makes breathing easier, such as in a Fowler’s or semi-Fowler’s position.
- **Administer oxygen** (if trained and equipment is available): Use a non-rebreather mask or nasal cannula if the patient has low oxygen levels.
- **Call for advanced medical help** if the condition is severe or worsening.

This assessment focuses on ensuring adequate breathing and quickly identifying respiratory distress signs so that proper care can be given.
